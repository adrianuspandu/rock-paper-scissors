# Rock Paper Scissors - Brain Training Game

**Rock Paper Scissors** is a SwiftUI game to train your brain to react quickly. The app will give you a random move (rock, papers, or scissors) and a random instruction between "Win" or "Lose". The user must pick a move to either "win" or "lose" the game depending on the app state.

## Learning Goals

This project helped me practice and understand:

- `@State` – Managing view state like score, alerts, and game logic
- `alert()` – Showing result feedback modally
- `ZStack`, `VStack`, `HStack` – SwiftUI layout system
- Using **custom views** like `MoveButton` for cleaner code
- Game logic using enums and switch statements
- Randomization with `Bool.random()` and `Int.random(in:)`
